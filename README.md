In this project, I developed a Google Map project with typescript. I created two different classes named 'User' and 'Company'. Then, I transferred these classes to the interface with the name 'Mappable'.
I took my objects from the 'CustomMap' class via the interface and created my 'maps' object. Then I put 'markers' on the maps and created Information Windows.

Dont forget change GOOGLEMAPSKEY on index.html .

Type codes 'parcel index.html' for run project
